Whenever you create a new asset account, the wallet will download the
account file and store it here based on asset account ID. (A randomly-
generated and previously-unused hash value.) Account IDs are NOT based
on a hash of the account file itself, since the hash changes everytime
the balance changes.

Whenever your account balance changes, the new account file will be stored
here and overwrite the last one.

IMPORTANT TODO:  Need more failsafe mechanisms, like keeping a backup of the
file automatically.  What if software crashes during file write? You can request
another copy from the server, but still.  These are questions that have to be
answered when database/security considerations are raised by the community
during the client/GUI development phase.

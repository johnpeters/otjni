Whenever you use the "getmint" command inside the command line wallet,
it will ask you for an asset type ID. (Matching the appropriate currency
contract.)  Then it will try to look up the minting keys for that asset
type on the server, and store them here in this directory in a file named
with the same asset type ID.

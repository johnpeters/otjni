Whenever you withdraw cash from the server, it will create a purse file
here in this directory, containing all the tokens. If the purse file already
exists (the filename is the Asset Type ID) then the wallet will load it up,
add the new tokens, and save it again.  So this file will continue to grow.

No matter how many accounts you have, all withdrawals of the same asset type
will go into the same purse with the asset type as its name.

How to handle these purses, and how to auto-back-them-up so IMPORTANT CASH DATA
is not lost, is an issue to be discussed when a NICE PRETTY CLIENT GUI is being
developed. *prod*

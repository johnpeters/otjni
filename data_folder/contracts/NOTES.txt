Whenever you are using the command line wallet, and you type the
"getcontract" command, it will ask you for the contract ID (or
Asset Type ID -- same thing.) Then it will download the contract
from the server, and save it here in this folder named using that
same ID.

Eventually the ID / file could be moved to any other database system
that the community decides upon.
